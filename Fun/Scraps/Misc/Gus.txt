Virgil I. Grissom, in full Virgil Ivan Grissom, byname Gus Grissom, (born April 3, 1926, Mitchell, Ind., U.S.—died Jan. 27, 1967, Cape Kennedy, Fla.), second U.S. astronaut to travel in space and the command pilot of the ill-fated Apollo 1 crew. He and his fellow astronauts Edward H. White and Roger B. Chaffee were killed, becoming the first casualties of the U.S. space program, when a flash fire swept their space capsule during a simulation of the scheduled Feb. 21, 1967, launching of Apollo 1.

Commissioned in the U.S. Air Force in 1951, Grissom flew 100 missions in the Korean War, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with cluster. He was a test pilot and flying instructor until 1959, when he was selected as one of the original seven astronauts for Project Mercury. On July 21, 1961, with a 15-minute suborbital journey aboard the space capsule Liberty Bell 7, Grissom became the third man to enter space. Upon splashdown, the explosive bolts of the capsule’s hatch unexpectedly opened, and Grissom immediately had to leave Liberty Bell 7, which sank in more than 4,500 metres (15,000 feet) of water. 

 On March 23, 1965, Grissom became the first man to return to space as he (as command pilot) and Lieutenant Commander John W. Young made three orbits in the first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3. During that flight Grissom demonstrated that a space capsule could be maneuvered manually.
