'''1. Dice Rolling Simulator

The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program
that simulates rolling dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose
a number between 1 and 6. (Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number
of sides on the die is up to you.) The program will print what that number is.
It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. For this project, you’ll
need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. For the average
die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. You’ll also want a function
that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.
Concepts to keep in mind:

Random
Integer
Print
While Loops'''

    '''This is the function to make the random numbers pop up when asked.'''
    cont = 1#This is the variable for the while loop
    while (cont == 1):
        print ("Welcome!")
        userInput = input("Press 1 to get a random number")
        #user input is whether they want to get a number or not.
        rand = random.randint(1, 6) #genny the number
        print (rand)
        contInput = input("Do you want to continue? 1 for yes 0 for no.")
        #This asks the user if they want to continue or not.
        #I had problems directly converting cont to the user input
        #therefore I used an if statement to compare the user input to the
        #condition and then setting it to the actual variable.
        if (contInput == 1):
            cont = 1
        else:
            cont = 0
